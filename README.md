# New-Mobile-Teaching-Platform
The mobile teaching platform is a practical system designed with students submitting homework as an example. The biggest feature of this system is its versatility and simple operability, which is suitable for computer students and teachers to submit and review assignments. With the increase in the number of students, the burden of teachers' homework reviews is getting heavier and heavier. In order to free teachers and students from heavy work and make the work more organized, convenient, and efficient, we have developed this mobile teaching platform.

1. Environment build

1.1 Development framework

We took over the teacher's project, and the original developer used the thinkPHP5.0 framework. When we first took over the project, we tried to use the latest stable version thinkPHP6.0 for development. After communicating with the original developers, we found that the work required to modify the framework was too large. Considering the time factor, we continued to use version 5.0.

1.2 PHP+mysql+Apache

The current configuration of the latest version is PHP7+mysql8+Apache2.4. After configuring the entire environment, it is found that the original code cannot be executed. After communicating with the original developers, it is consistent with their original configuration, and the XAMPP integrated configuration environment is used.

2. Database Design

Since the original system already has a part of the database, we have supplemented and improved it and redesigned it on the basis of the original system. Combined with the needs of system functions, we have added a part of the relationship for the realization of new functions and the optimization of original functions. However, due to incomplete documentation, the understanding of the original database design concept has brought us a lot of trouble. After data verification, function comparison verification, and consultation with the original developers, we have sorted out the original database situation, and we can build on this basis. improve on.

3. Timing and pre-planning

3.1 Timing

During the course setting, we had a lot of time wasted due to improper time planning. This situation brought us a lot of troubles. Through this course setting, we have improved our ability to master time and plan. I believe this ability will be of great help to us. Future development is of great help. On the road to future development, we need more scientific time planning.

3.2 Pre-planning

Most of the problems we encountered were due to the lack of suitable planning and detailed documentation guidance, the original developers were far away from us, and the communication was not convenient. And from the beginning of setting up the environment, we suffered from the lack of documentation guidance. The setting up of an inappropriate environment and the difficulty in understanding the original database made it difficult for us to move forward. In the subsequent development process, we also did not find a suitable development step for a period of time and wasted a lot of time reading code that had nothing to do with our work. After this lesson, we learned how to quickly understand the original project in the real development scenario, and personally experienced the importance of documentation. After we have completed all the functions of the system, we will sort out the relevant written materials and keep them well, so as to leave a good foundation for someone to improve and modify them again in the future. At the same time, we wrote a document to help others quickly get started with this system, which recorded the difficulties we encountered and the solutions, so as to prevent future generations from going through the muddy water we have gone through, and hope that it will be helpful to future system maintainers .

1．	环境搭建

1.1 开发框架  

我们接手的是老师的项目，原开发人员使用thinkPHP5.0框架。初接手该项目时我们曾尝试使用最新的稳定版本thinkPHP6.0进行开发，与原开发人员交流后我们发现修改框架所需工作量过大，考虑到时间因素我们沿用5.0版本。

1.2 PHP+mysql+Apache

当前最新版本的配置为PHP7+mysql8+Apache2.4，在配置完全部环境后发现原始代码无法执行，与原开发人员交流后与他们最初的配置保持一致，使用XAMPP集成配置环境.

2．	数据库设计

由于原始系统已有一部分数据库，我们在原来的基础上进行补充完善以及再设计，结合系统功能需要增加了一部分关系用于新增功能的实现以及原有功能的优化。但是由于文档不全，原有数据库设计理念的理解给我们带来了很大的麻烦，经过数据验证、功能的对比验证、咨询原开发人员等我们整理好了原有的数据库情况，才能在此基础上进行改进。

3．	时间安排与前期规划

3.1 时间安排

课设进行中我们由于时间规划不当有过大量的时间浪费，这种情况给我们带来了很多困扰，通过此次课设我们对于时间的掌握和规划能力更上一筹，相信这份能力对我们以后的发展有着极大的帮助。未来的开发之路上我们需要更加科学的时间规划。

3.2 前期规划

我们遇到的一大部分问题是由于没有适合的规划以及详细的文档指导，原开发人员与我们距离较远，交流也不太方便。并且从搭建环境开始我们就吃到了没有文档指导的苦头，搭建了不合适的环境以及原始数据库了解困难让我们前期寸步难行。
在后来的开发过程中我们也有一段时间没有找到合适的开发步骤而浪费了很多时间来阅读与我们的工作无关的代码。经过本次课设我们了解到的真实的开发场景应该如何进行原有项目的快速了解，并且亲身体验到了文档的重要性。在我们完成该系统的所有功能后我们会把相关的文字材料整理出来保存好，为以后有人再次进行完善和修改留下良好的基础。
与其同时我们书写了一份帮助别人快速上手此系统的文档，其中记录了我们遇到的困难以及解决方法，防止后人再淌我们走过的混水，希望对以后的系统维护人员有所帮助。
