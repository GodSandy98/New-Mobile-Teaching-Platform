# New-Mobile-Teaching-Platform
The mobile teaching platform is a practical system designed with students submitting homework as an example. The biggest feature of this system is its versatility and simple operability, which is suitable for computer students and teachers to submit and review assignments. With the increase in the number of students, the burden of teachers' homework reviews is getting heavier and heavier. In order to free teachers and students from heavy work and make the work more organized, convenient, and efficient, we have developed this mobile teaching platform.
